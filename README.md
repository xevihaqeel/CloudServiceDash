# Project Title

## Description

This project is a web application dashboard designed to simulate random events using data analysis and visualization. It uses a dataset (e.g., car advertisement dataset) to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create interactive visualizations.

The project is implemented using Python and several libraries including pandas for data manipulation, streamlit for web app framework, and plotly.express and altair for data visualization.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python environment with the following packages installed: pandas, streamlit, plotly.express, and altair.
- VS Code or any preferred code editor.
- Git and GitHub account.
- Render.com account.

### Installation

1. Clone the git repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you haven't already, create a new Python environment and install the necessary packages.
4. Set the Python interpreter in VS Code to the one used by the virtual environment.

## Usage

1. Download the car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv) or your own dataset in CSV format and place it in the root directory of the project.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis using the EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook saved in the notebooks directory of the project.
3. Develop the web application dashboard by writing code into the app.py file in the root of the projectâ€™s directory.
4. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
